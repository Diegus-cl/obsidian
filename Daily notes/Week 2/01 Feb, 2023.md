# Transpara's progress

- [x] Change the file name “apiCalls” to “tSystemAPIHelper”
- [x] Change the function “installModule” to “CreateTSystemComponent”
- [x]  Add SuffixAPI to the constants
- [x] in the file “apiCalls” use the “constants”
- [ ]  Calculate the next unused port from the constants file instead of using “const MODULE_PORT = 10002;” constant from the “apiCalls” file
- [ ]  Review the useEffect in step 6 to install the component, perhaps it is better to use a button “next” of step 5 to install instead of useEffect.

**About tmon installation:**

- [x] by default when installing tmon install tmon_agent.
- [ ] Add another option to install tmon_agent alone.
