# Interesting Notes of the Day

Today I met Camila, she is a mysterious person, but I like her. I think there is some chemistry going on. 

This was a little crazy, because I went with Fray to pick up a package from a local post office called MRW. After that I went with her to her ballet, and inmediately after that I went to a place called "Aventura Plaza" that was pretty close

I would like to be more motivated in my job. But I've been struggling to concentrate in general. Just to write this I had to go to a very tough mental resistance.

## I'm Grateful for

- Meeting Camila
- Christian spending time with us
- Spending some time with Fray
 
## I'm Sad for

- Maybe not leaving the impression I wanted on Camila
- Not being as motivated as I want
- Losing money on Binance
