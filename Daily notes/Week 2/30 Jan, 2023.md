# Interesting Notes of the Day

I knew better this girl called Camila. She is so incredibly liberal, and she may expose me to drugs and sex. I wonder if I should continue talking with her. But my curiosity just wants to experience having sex with other people.

I'm a little scared that doing this could harm my relationship with Fray, something that is the last thing that I want

## I'm Grateful for

- Knowing Camila
- My fifth year teacher talking to me
- Aurora (a friend's girlfriend) talking to me about Porto

## I'm Sad for

- Not being able to live in Portugal
- Not living in my own home
