# Interesting Notes of the Day

This was a great day. I got a new job proposal and I accepted it. I will be tested for three months at a rate of 300USD/month, which is not a lot, but it's a start. If I sum that with my current Job, that is 1500USD/month, which is a lot. I really didn't expect I could be earning that much by now

On the other side, I'm pretty sure that Fray has had great progress on forgiving me, she was much more welcoming with me today, and we spent good time together

## I'm Grateful for

- Having job opportunities 
- Being able to keep repairing my relationship

## I'm Sad for

- Not having as much money as I should have right know. Don't use leverage, folks!
