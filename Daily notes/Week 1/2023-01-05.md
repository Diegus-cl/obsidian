Today I gifted Fray a Mi Band 4 that I got from Luis (Caztor).

Miguel and I did great on the weekly meeting for Transpara. I feel that I could've done a lot more, but I'm not feeling that motivated, I think that is starting to change.

I walked Pi (My dog), with my niece. He met another Jack Russell that was 8 years old and fat. It's 3 days until his birthday.

I wanted to study on Datacamp but I wasn't able to.

*Today I felt*: 
- Overwhelmed
- Depressed (a little)
- Uncertain
- Optimistic
