# Transpara's progress

- In "fu-frontend", change package.json start script from `react-scripts start`, to `react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start` for it to work properly
- update state after deleting and adding new modules, so the user doesn't have to refresh in order to see the changes made

# Interesting Notes of the Day

Today was my first day working a back9, this local company that does ticketing for events and webpages. I got assigned a couple of projects to work on, and I deployed them on my machine, and everything went well. 

This team strikes me as unorganized, but they are pretty charismatic, and that is what I like.

I really hope I can make having two jobs work out, because that would make moving to portugal next year so much easier. Lets see what happens

## I'm Grateful for

- Having another job, so I can get more money
- Fray being kind to me

## I'm Sad for

- The possibility of me having two jobs going wrong
